version:             1.0.0.0
synopsis:            Memoize IO actions
description:
  Transform an IO action into a similar IO action
  that performs the original action only once.
  .
  You can choose to perform the original action
  in one of three ways:
  .
  (1) lazily (might never be performed)
  .
  (2) eagerly
  .
  (3) concurrently (eager)
  .
  Special thanks to shachaf and headprogrammingczar from #haskell irc
  for helping me reason about the behavior of this library.
